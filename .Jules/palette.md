## 2024-05-22 - [Flutter Custom Button Accessibility]
**Learning:** In Flutter, simply wrapping a `GestureDetector` with `Semantics` is not enough for a complete "button" experience. To get both accessibility (screen reader labels) and visual feedback (Material ripple), the structure must be `Semantics(container: true) > Material > InkWell`. The `container: true` on Semantics is critical for merging the semantic node with the children so that tools like `find.bySemanticsLabel` work correctly on the "button" unit, rather than finding disjointed parts.
**Action:** When refactoring custom buttons for accessibility, always ensure the ripple (`InkWell`) is on a `Material` widget and that the entire interactive area is wrapped in `Semantics(container: true, button: true, ...)` to present a unified accessible element.
